They currently permit 3,223 county-wide. They currently allow for 3900, so if we extrapolate out there will be an additional 440 VHR permits in the Placer County portion of the Tahoe Basin. Washoe has no cap, but  we don’t have any reason to believe it will increase. El Dorado is at the cap. CSLT is at the cap. Douglas is currently 50 below the cap, so we will assume these all get used.
