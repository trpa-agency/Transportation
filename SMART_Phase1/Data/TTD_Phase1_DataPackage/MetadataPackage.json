      "description": "The Tahoe Transportation District (TTD) and regional partners are seeking to enhance transportation safety and mobility along key corridors in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The roadway network entering, traveling within, and leaving the Tahoe Basin lacks the infrastructure required to acquire real-time and historical traffic and congestion data. This pilot project aims to support TTD and the regional partners in collecting accurate count data at each of the seven entry/exit points of the Tahoe Basin and along the Truckee/US80/SR267/SR89 roadways.The project is designed to plan, prototype, test, and evaluate a limited deployment of a data collection sensor infrastructure to gather transportation and traveler-related information. The goal is to integrate this information into a single cloud-based open source or interface for reporting and management. This information will be utilized by TTD, TRPA, partners, commuters, and travelers within the Tahoe Basin and adjoining areas to provide an integrated infrastructure for collecting vehicle data. This data will be incorporated into a database for various stakeholders.Furthermore, the project will establish the framework for long-term data collection across the region and integrate multiple transportation data sources for efficient use by partner agencies. It will propel the region toward real-time parking availability for motorists and improve the ease of transit use, walking, and bicycling. Other long-term uses include sharing information about weather hazards, closures, construction, or crashes.",
