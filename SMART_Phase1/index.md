# Transportation Patterns

Welcome to the metadata for the **Transportation Patterns** page. This space documents our efforts to analyze and visualize transportation trends in the Lake Tahoe Basin using modern data engineering techniques and user-centered design.

## Project Overview

This project explores transportation patterns in Tahoe using traffic camera AI insights from the DERQ platform and local data pipelines. The goal is to support informed decision-making around safety, congestion, and mobility planning.

---

## Data Engineering

Our data engineering pipeline integrates traffic insights from the DERQ INSIGHT API, including vehicle and vulnerable road user counts, speed distributions, and safety events. Data is processed and visualized using Python notebooks.

## DERQ Platform

DERQ provides an array of real-time safety and traffic insights, providing up-to-date, accurate and granular data enabling in-depth analysis of safety issues, countermeasure development, and traffic performance assessment.
